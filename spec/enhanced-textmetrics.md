# Enhanced TextMetrics

**Status**: explainer.

## Goals

Extend the capabilities of `TextMetrics` to support selection rectangles and bounding box queries over character ranges. This would additionally enable precise caret positioning.

## Rationale

Users should be able to interact with canvas-based text input that correctly renders selection and caret positions.

All metrics available through DOM APIs should also be available on `measureText()`. Furthermore, `measureText()` will always be limited to a single style, and therefore has the potential to be slightly faster (as it doesn‚Äôt need layout). `measureText()` must return the same values as the equivalent DOM APIs.

We also want to provide more power to current canvas text rendering APIs.


## Proposal

```webidl
dictionary TextAnchorPoint {
  DOMString align;
  DOMString baseline;
};

[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface TextCluster {
    attribute double x;
    attribute double y;
    readonly attribute unsigned long begin;
    readonly attribute unsigned long end;
    readonly attribute DOMString align;
    readonly attribute DOMString baseline;
};

[Exposed=(Window,Worker)] interface TextMetrics {
  // ... extended from current TextMetrics.
  
  sequence<DOMRectReadOnly> getSelectionRects(unsigned long start, unsigned long end);
  DOMRectReadOnly getActualBoundingBox(unsigned long start, unsigned long end);
  sequence<TextCluster> getTextClusters(unsigned long start, unsigned long end, optional TextAnchorPoint anchor_point);

  unsigned long caretPositionFromOffset(double offset);
};

interface CanvasRenderingContext2D {
    // ... extended from current CanvasRenderingContext2D.

    void fillTextCluster(TextCluster textCluster, double x, double y);
};
```

`getSelectionRects()` returns the set of rectangles that the UA would render as selection to select a particular character range.

`getActualBoundingBox()` returns an equivalent box to `TextMetrics.actualBoundingBox`, i.e., the bounding rectangle for the drawing of that range. Notice that this can be (and usually is) different from the selection rect, as those are about the flow and advance of the text. A font that is particularly slanted or whose accents go beyond the flow of text will have a different paint bounding box. For example: if you select this: ***W*** you will see that the end of the W is outside the selection area, which would be covered by the paint (actual bounding box) area.

`caretPositionFromPoint()` returns the character offset for the character at the given `offset` distance from the start position of the text run (accounting for `textAlign` and `textBaseline`) with offset always increasing
left to right (so negative offsets are valid). Values to the left or right of the text bounds will return 0 or
`num_characters` depending on the writing direction. The functionality is similar but not identical to [`document.caretPositionFromPoint`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/caretPositionFromPoint). In particular, there is no need to return the element containing the caret and offsets beyond the boundaries of the string are acceptable.

`getTextClusters()` provides the ability to render minimal grapheme clusters (in conjunction with a new method for the canvas rendering context, more on that later). That is, for the character range given as in input, it returns the minimal rendering operations broken down as much as logically possible, with their corresponding positional data. The position is calculated with the original anchor point for the text as reference, while the `text_align` and `text_baseline` parameters determine the desired alignment of each cluster.

To actually render these clusters on the screen, a new method for the rendering context is proposed: `fillTextCluster()`. It renders the cluster with the `text_align` and `text_baseline` stored in the object, ignoring tha values set in the context. Additionally, to guarantee that the rendered cluster is accurate with the measured text, all `CanvasTextDrawingStyles` must be applied as they were when `ctx.measureText()` was called, regardless of any changes in these values on the context since. Note that to guarantee that the shaping of each cluster is indeed the same as it was when measured, it's necessary to use the whole string as context when rendering each cluster.

For `text_align` specifically, the position is calculated in regards of the advance of said grapheme cluster in the text. For example: if the `text_align` passed to the function is `center`, for the letter **T** in the string **Test**, the position returned will be not exactly be in the middle of the **T**. This is because the advance is reduced by the kerning between the first two letters, making it less than the width of a **T** rendered on its own.

`getSelectionRects()`, `getActualBoundingBox()`, and `getTextClusters()` operate in character ranges and use positions relative to the text‚Äôs origin (i.e., `textBaseline`/`textAlign` is taken into account).

## Example usage

```js
const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

const textMetrics = ctx.measureText("let's do this");
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
const boxForSecondWord = textMetrics.getActualBoundingBox(6, 8);
ctx.fillRect(
    boxForSecondWord.x,
    boxForSecondWord.y,
    boxForSecondWord.width,
    boxForSecondWord.height,
);
const selectionForThirdWord = textMetrics.getSelectionRects(9, 13);
ctx.fillStyle = 'lightblue';
for (const s of selectionForThirdWord) {
    ctx.fillRect(s.x, s.y, s.width, s.height);
}
ctx.fillStyle = 'black';
ctx.fillText("let's do this");
```

`getSelectionRects()` and `getActualBoundingBox()` can be used on Chrome Canary (starting from version `127.0.6483.0` and `128.0.6573.0` respectively) by enabling the feature with `--enable-features=ExtendedTextMetrics` (or the general `--enable-experimental-web-platform-features`). 

```js
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.font = '60px serif';
ctx.textAlign = 'left';
ctx.textBaseline = 'middle';

const text = 'Colors üé® are üèéÔ∏è fine!';
let tm = ctx.measureText(text);
let clusters = tm.getTextClustersForRange(0, text.length,
                                         {align: 'left', 
                                          baseline: 'middle'});

const colors = ['orange', 'navy', 'teal', 'crimson'];
for(let cluster of clusters) {
    ctx.fillStyle = colors[cluster.begin % colors.length];
    ctx.fillTextCluster(cluster);
}
```
